# High Availability and Disaster Recovery [High Availability]
* HADR Planning
    * Redundent Servers or distributed storage solutions.
    * RTO: recovery time objectives
    * RPO: recovery point objectives

## HA options for virtual Machines
* Log-shipping: Backup and restore to create duplicate db.
    * Transaction replay or shipping.

* Always On Availability Group: Similar to log-shipping. Each replica is aware of the status of other replicas in the group. 

* Always on Failover Cluster Instance: Provice instance-level protection, duplicates server noes tot protect logins, agent jobs, and other instance-lvel configuration settings,  uses as single shared pool of storage for db's data.

---
1. Availability Set: 99.95
    * multiple servers within a data center
    * different fault set (non-shared resource)
2. Availability Zone: 99.99
    * Multiple data centers in same regions
    * Physically distanced
3. Azure site recovery: 99.90
    * across regions. 
    * > more than 2 hours

### Active Geo-Replication
* RPO: 5 sec
* Failover time: 30 sec
* Data management &rarr; create replica 
* Azure sql database

### Auto Failover group
* region redundant replicas.
* Listener services are used to route applications.
* R/W and read-only listeners send traffic to the appropriate replica.
* During an outage, traffic is automatically routed to available servers in an Auto Failover Group.
(Azure sql database and managed instance.)

## Windows Server Failover Cluster:
* Quorum
* Witness
    * 4 + witness (best all up)

## Always On Availability Group
* Sync replication and async replication
* Ownership transition to different  node, with a different end point connection
* Azure load balancers

1. Chnages on the feature using the configuration manager.
2. Grant authority to the system user account.


## Backup and restore a database.
* Full backup
* Differential backups
* Trans log backup
* tail log backup

>UP to 15-minute recovery point objective.
> Full backup: Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily
> Diff backup:
> Log backup:

#### Recovery Services vault
* Add autoprotect.
* Go to service and recovery services vault.
    * Protected items > show list of all the backups.
        * get option for backup and restore option

#### Backup PaaS:
* Once a week, 12 hours and 5 to 10 minutes. 
* geo-redundant blob storage in multiple data centre.

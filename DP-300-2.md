## Monitoring Insights: 
Inside the monitoring tab in the insight.

## Perfmon (performance Monitor)
- **Perfmon** is a Windows tool that allows you to monitor the performance of various system components.
- It can be used to collect and analyze performance data from various sources, including the operating system, applications, and hardware.

## Create automated alerts
- Monitor &rarr; Alerts &rarr; New Alert Rule

>  Scope: Select the resource you want to monitor.\
>  Condition: Define the condition that will trigger the alert.\
>  Action Group: Specify the action to take when the alert is triggered, such as sending an email or SMS.\

## Intelligent Insights: Gives hardware and software insights (sql server itself)

Performance overview, performance recommendations, query performance insights, and diagnostic settings.


## Storage Configuration
* Blob storage: Docs, images, video and for backup files.
* azure files: create network file share.
* azure tables: Azure Cosmos DB: NoSQL data and schemaless key/value data

* Azure DISK: accessed only from within the VM, best for sql server data and log files.

#### AZURE DISK
* Standard HDD for infrequent access data
* Standard SSD: Low traffic db and test and dev
* Premium SSD: prod db, read caching
* Ultra disk: submillisecond.


#### 3 types:
* general
* transactional processing 
* data warehousing

&rarr; Setting to configure to edit the storage
&rarr; Setting to size to edit the storage\

Various series of VM needs to be learnt

#### Allocate resource governer
* Split memory, compute and I/O capacity into seperate pools.
* Default: 
    * internal: all ciritcal sql server function
    * default: All other connections
    * Additional user defined: create resource pool for maintanence. 
        * Max/min CPU %
        * memory %
        * NUMA node affinity
        * Max/min IOPS per volume.

> node affinity: Configure the SQL Server to use specific CPU cores or NUMA (non-uniform memory access) nodes, thereby controlling the server schedules and utilize processor resources. Can be done using affinity mask.\

* CPU Affnity: which cpu core it can use for general processing task (queries, memory management). Core's memeory might need to be reloaded.
* I/O affinity: CPU core for its disk i/ops. 

Leave these to default.

##### WORKLOAD Groups
* contianer for users that requires access to the same resource pool.

### Database level performance Options
* Compatibility level
* Alter database <DB> set compatibility_level=<>.


* COMPATIBILITY: Can set to each database individually
* Max degree of parallelism: number of processors in query processing. Using query hits or Resource governer workload groups.
* Legacy cardinality estimation: Force older cardinality estimator for query exection plans; can be used with modern compatibility levels.
* last_Query_plan_stats: Retains actual execution plan metrics for database with >150. CPU, execution time, maxDOP, memory granted and used. 
* optimize for ad hoc workloads: stores stub execution plan in the cache for database with a lot of single-use queries; keep the plan cache small by not storing full plans for queries that are not reused.


### Intelligent Query Processing
* Since 2017

* Adaptive joins: dynamic select a join type during runtime based on the actual number of input rows, rather than the estimated number of input rows. (140)
* Interleaved execution: is used for multi-statement TVF; instead of a fixed guess of 1 or 100 rows, actual row counts are obtained during plan generation.
    * Table-valued deferred compilations:
        * estimator used to assume only one row woruld be returned by TVF used in a query. Now actual row counts.
* Memoery grant feedback: adjust memory allocations for subsequent executions and prevents memory over-grants or under-grants.

* Batch mode on rowstore: needed column store indexes but now operations on many rows at once. Good for lot of table joins and affgregate.
* T-SQL Scalar UDF inlining: scalar user-defined function forced the query to operate on one row at a time, didn't allow cost optimizer to function efficiently but now its converted into sql subqueires automatically and allow the processor to better predict the result.
* Approx query processing: approx_count_distinct() function. Big benefit in big-data. 2% error rate within 97% probability.

### Rebuild and Reorganize Indexes
* Index store sorted pointers to data rows.
* Data on disk becomes out of sink causing index fragmentation.
* check sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats, sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats and sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats to evaluate your current index usage patterns.

&rarr; Remove unused index. review query store and extended events. 

## Maintain statistics:
* synchronous and asynchronous.

2019&rarr; compatibility level 150

## Optimizing Query Performance
### Estimated and actual query plans
* Estimated and actual rows

#### Plan Cache: for same query. Plan cache store estimated plans that are createed before the query executes. 

#### Reading query plan: Right to left and top to bottom. 
&rarr; Seek and Scan. 
&rarr; Nested look and hash match
&rarr; Segment, sort, sequence project, table spool, stream aggregate, compute scalar


### Query store
* All the historical plans generated for each query and how each performed.
* High variation queries: queries perform differently.
* Regressed queries: current with previous.

### DMV
* data store in DMV.
```SQL
-- Monitor resource use
select * from sys.dm_db_resource_stats;
select * from sys.server_resource_stats;

--connections
select * from sys.dm_exec_connections;


-- index management
select * from sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats; -- count of existing index operation, usage
select * from sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats (NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL); -- utilisation of existing indexes

select * from sys.dm_db_stats_properties; --last time stat was updated.

select * from sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats; --index frag

select * from sys.dm_db_missing_index_details; -- missing and useful indexes.


-- query plan
select * from sys.dm_exec_cached_plans; -- plan cache

select * from sys.dm_exec_query_plan; -- view estimated execution plan

select * from sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats; -- actual plan

-- wait stat
select * from sys.dm_os_wait_stats;
select * from sys.dm_exec_session_wait_stats;
```

## Wait statistics, Locks and Blocks
* resource locks and other reasons like backups and all.
* ACID: atomic, consistent and isolated. 
    * small number row locks, and then only after certain level table lock.

>sys.dm_tran_locks\
>sys.dm_exec_requests.

>Extended events

## automated Maintanence plan
&rarr; using the maintanence plan wizard in the extended events. 

### Automatic notifications and alerts
&rarr;enable mail profile &rarr; Operator 
   * &rarr; for any maintanence jobs set the notifications or alerts.
   * Create alert based on serverity, performance condition alert. 

### Extended events:
* Session: Define the session and start it.
* Events: Occuerance fo monitoring points of interests.
    * Admin events: index scan, error log
    * Operational events: automated tuning event.
    * Analytic: when store procedure are reterived from procedure cache or fragmented.
    * Debug: When working with MS support representatives. 

* On the setup wizard: setup events, data storage: ring buffer is common old is overwritten and temporary in memeory and discarded when session ends.\
>schedule when the CPU is ideal is a thing.

## Azure Resource Manager Templates (ARM)
* deployment templates.
* JSON deployement templates. 
* Using Windows powershell, azure CLI, AZURE portal.

>
>
>
* Sample Deployment templates:
    * "parameters": Servername, sqldbname, location, adminlogin
    * "variables": reuse values and experession within a template. can pass outside of template.
    * "resources": Could be multiple.
>
* Deploy template: Create a resource and template deployment with purple icon or template specs. Goes to basic and all.
>
* Automate with BiCEP, powershell and Azure CLI: 
    * new language like JSON. local deployement files.
    * Use powershell:
        * New-AzResourceGroup -Name exampleRG -Location eastus
        * New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceName exampleRG -TemplateFile ./main.bicep -administratorLogin "<admin-login>"
    * Azure CLI: support bash
        * az sql server create

# Migration of SQL Server On-Premise to Azure
---
## Types of system in AZURE
1. VM for SQL Server (IaaS)
2. Azure SQL Database (SaaS)
3. Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS)

## Pricing Models.
* General Purpose: vCore pricing
* Large scale: Hyperscale storage.
* Serverless Tiers: Scaling resouces, like elastic pool. DTUs


### MYSQL/MariaDB: Fully managed database server. Single and Service
>Adjust vCores, Storage and backup retention. 

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL: 
> High Availability, automatic backups, maintenance and service patches\
> Elastic Resource scaling, security monitoring
* Types: Single server, flexible server (vertical scaling) and hyperscale deployments (citus /horizontal scaling).

# Azure on VM:
&rarr; BYOL and Pay as you go.

1. **A-series**: low-vol developement or test databases. 
2. **B-Series**: Like A-series workloads with the ability to brust perfromance temporarily.
3. **D-Series**: Faster processor
4. **E-Series**: Memory optimised for in-memory analytics
5. **F-Series**: web server and gaming application
6. **H-Series**: Scientific research and data modeling

## High Availability
### 1. Availability Zones
&rarr; Deploy VM in region close to customers.
&rarr; AZ within regions are different physical locations.

### 2. Availability Sets
&rarr; Availability set are located within the same location but in different servers still might sare resource like cooler and all.

### Always on Availability Groups
* Group tow or more sql server instance together, one is "primary replication" and all other are "secondary replicas".
* Txn are first commited to primary replica and synchronously or asynchronously to secondary replicas.
* Secondary can be primary.
---
## Geo-Redundant Storage
* Store full and diff backup in Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies. Synchronously three times in single physical location in primary region, then async to a single physical location in a secondary region. within secondary region, data copied synchronusly thre additional times. 
* RA-GRS: remote are read-only access.
* can backup all of the VMs.

# Deploying a SQL server VM from marketplace. 
&rarr; subscription
&rarr; resource group
&rarr; Names, regions, availability options.
&rarr; Azure spot instance (not consumed by others can pull)
&rarr; 3389 Default port, OS disk types. Encryption settings, Azure AD, patch orchestration options (automatic by os), Additional extention and custom data. 
&rarr; Choose the SQL server settings and storage configurations. 

>Virtual machine: the actual hardware and SQL virtual machine is the actual sql server. 
---
# Migration Options
* Backup and Restore (should do the user seperately)
* Detach and attach data and log files
* ship a hard drive using azure import/export service
* add VM to always on availability group then induce a failover. 

## Migration helper
* Data migration assistant: Create report on migration issues. 
* Azure migrate tool: access current situation and plan migration and modernization
* Azure data migration service (ADMS): Azure to azure, azure to cloud.

# <span style="color: skyblue;">The azure database platform as a service (Paas)</span>
##service tier
* DTU-based purchasing model: compute, storage and I/O (basic, standard and premium)
* vCore purchasing model: compute and storage
    * general purpose: Azure blob storage
    * Business critical: SSD storage, read-only database replica for querying and reporting
    * Hyper scale: billed for storage used, 4TB max for general and 100TB for business critical.

* vCore service tiers:
    * General-purpose provisioned compute tier:billed per hour, preallocate specific number
    * General-purpose serverless compute tier: max and min vcore, pilled per second (autopause)

---
Benefits of Azure SQL db
* automatic backups.
    * full: week
    * diff: 12 hrs
    * txn log backups: 5-10 mins.
* Replication: four read-only replicas can be added to single or pooled azure sql db. (configure to auto-failover group. without requiring to connect to new end-point in app)

>hyperscale can't be changed
(ZRS AND LRS) in backup setup.
> for elastic: dynamic server storage and dynamic serverless compute is not available. Only vcore and DTU pricing model

# Sql managed instance:
* Supports Sql Agent, cross-database queries, distributed transactions, and common language runtime [CLR] like a VM
* Store up to 100 individual database on a single managed instance.
* backup, auto security, HA.

### SQL DATA SYNC (Hybrid environment)
&rarr; Start by designating an Azure SQL Database as the SYNC HUB in the manged tab of the azure portal
* Hub and Spoke model. Hub and member ( for conflict resolution)

Sync can be bi-directional. 
(must have PK, no identity columns, can't use hypens)


# Authentication and Authorisation:
---
* can sync with windows server AD

## Security Principal and securables
* Groups and users.
* Objects in the database using schema.
>what prinicipal can do in securables

### Permissions
* Control and execute. Grant, revoke and deny.

```SQL
create ROLE DataAnalyst;
grant select, insert on SCHEMA::Sales to DataAnalyst;
Alter role DataAnalyst ADD Member Max;
Deny insert to schema::sales to max;
```

#### Policy of Least Privilege: roles.
### Built-in db roles:
* db_datareader:
* db_datawriter:
* db_ddladmin: create and modify database objects
* db_access admin: grant permission
* db_denydatareader and db_denydatawriter:
* db_backupoperator: sql server, VM and managed instance to allow backup activities. (automatics)
* dbmanager and loginmanager: can delete and create db and login respectively.  Loginmanager and Dbmanager are two roles specific to Azure SQL Database.


## Assign a DB admin to a person. 
CREATE USER [<username>@yourdomain.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;\
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [<username>@yourdomain.com];

>sp_set_database_firewall_rule

# Data Security
## TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)
Data at rest when its written to disk, return data from memory to disk
Data backup doesn't require decryption.

&rarr; Security &rarr; Transparent data encryption

## Dynamic data masking
&rarr; Security &rarr; DDM


## Alwyas encrypt in transit
Enclave, sql server temporarily decrypt the encrypted values in order to apply the filters and pattern matching.

## Configure TLS
* SSL Certificates since 1995. 
---

* requires valid digital certificate, which is self-obtained or issued by an internal or commerical CA
* Install OS certificate store, configure SQL server to use the installed certificate for encryption.
* Enable forceencryotion. 

## Defender for SQL
>sql vulnerability assessment: monitor configurations like misconfig, permission, vulnerable config

>advanced threat protection: reactive, suspecious behaviour patterns, location.


# Compliance Control
## Classification of sensative data
Discovery &rarr; Labeling (add labels) &rarr; Reporting

## Microsoft Purview
> Classify and apply sensativity lables, searchable data catalog

> Security, Governance and risk and compliance.\
data map catalog sharing policy, risk and compliance covers audit and Data lifecycle management.

## Ledge (Tamper Evident): on top of blockchain. 
* Updatable ledger tables
* Append-only ledger tables


Database digests good copies of the blockchain to a secure, offsite location, point of comparision to the current database blockchain,

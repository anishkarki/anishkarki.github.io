# OCI Exam Notes: ADB-D Maintenance Scheduling

## Key Concepts
- **Autonomous Database Dedicated (ADB-D)** allows **custom patching schedules**.  
- Customers control:
  - **Quarter** → which month  
  - **Month** → which week  
  - **Week** → which day  
  - **Day** → which patching window  
- Schedule can be **changed dynamically** if needed.

## Best Practices
- Patch flow: **Dev → Staging → Production**.  
- Dev can run latest, Prod can lag behind (alternate quarters).  
- Different DBs (e.g., mission-critical) can have **unique schedules**.  

## Maintenance Options
- Independent scheduling for **infrastructure, cluster, and container DB**.  
- Options: **skip, reschedule, patch now**.  
- Transparent application continuity built-in.  

## Updates & Notifications
- Updates released **quarterly**.  
- Shown in **OCI Console** + **OCI Notifications**.  
- Fleet admins may run **different patch levels** across environments.  

## One-Off Patching
- Outside normal cycle.  
- Customer can **initiate patch now** or **reschedule**.  
- Events/notifications track schedule, reminders, start, and end.

---
**Exam Tip:** Remember that **ADB-D = customer-controlled scheduling**, unlike shared ADB where Oracle controls patching.

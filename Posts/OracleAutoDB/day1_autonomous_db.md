---

## Overview & Value Proposition

- **Revolutionizes data management** — eliminates full-stack administration burden.
- Lets you **focus on innovation, app development, and business logic**.
- Oracle **fully manages infrastructure, maintenance, security, and tuning**.
- **99.95% availability SLA** — backed by 20+ years of automation maturity (since Oracle 9i → 21c → 23ai).
- Built on **Oracle Engineered Systems** — preconfigured, retested, optimized platform.

---

## ADB is a Family of Services  
*Same core Autonomous Database, optimized per workload*

### 1. **Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)**
- Optimized for **analytics**: data warehouses, data marts, data lakes.
- **Columnar storage** by default → best for analytical queries.
- Uses **storage indexes, result cache, auto-parallelization** for fast analytics.
- Memory used for **large joins & aggregations (GROUP BYs)**.
- Stats gathered **during bulk loads**.

### 2. **Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP)**
- Optimized for **OLTP & mixed workloads** — ideal for new app dev.
- **Row storage** by default → best for fast single-row lookups.
- Uses **indexes** for transaction speed.
- Memory used to **cache active dataset** → avoids I/O.
- Uses **RAC (Real Application Clusters)** for in-memory access across nodes.
- Stats gathered **periodically** (due to traditional INSERTs).
- **Auto-detects & creates missing indexes**.

> **Both share the same feature set**:  
> - Automated provisioning, patching, backups, scaling, security  
> - Exadata infrastructure → world-class performance & availability  
> - Native **JSON support** + **SODA APIs** + **SQL for JSON**  
> - **RESTful endpoints** for easy app integration  
> - **MongoDB API compatibility** → simplifies dev for MongoDB users

---

## Data Storage & Optimization Flexibility

- Default storage format (row/column) can be **overridden** per table → flexibility for hybrid use cases.
- **Optimizer statistics kept current automatically** → ensures optimal query plans.
- **SQL Plan Management** prevents performance regressions → plans only change if better.

---

## Deployment Options

### ➤ **ADB Serverless (ADP Serverless)**

- **Simple, elastic, pay-per-use**.
- Start small → scale big:  
  - **Compute**: 1 → 512+ ECPUs (auto-scaling)  
  - **Storage**:  
    - ADW: Start at 1 TB → 100s of TB  
    - ATP: Start at 20 GB → scale up  
- **Billing**: Pay only while running → can STOP and avoid CPU charges.
- **Auto-failover**, zero data loss, full security & protection.
- Ideal for: Dev/test, variable workloads, startups, cost-sensitive projects.

### ➤ **ADB Dedicated (ADP Dedicated)**

- **Private, isolated cloud within public cloud**.
- **Dedicated Exadata infrastructure** — full control over:  
  - Compute, memory, network, storage  
  - Provisioning schedules  
  - Software updates  
  - Server density & availability policies
- Physically separated from other tenants → **highest isolation & compliance**.
- Runs **any size/criticality database**.
- Ideal for: Enterprises, regulated industries, custom ops requirements.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- ADB = **Self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing** database.
- Choose **ADW for analytics**, **ATP for transactions** — same engine, different optimizations.
- Deployment: **Serverless for agility & cost**, **Dedicated for control & isolation**.
- Oracle’s 20+ years of automation + Exadata = unmatched reliability & performance.
- Developer-friendly: JSON, REST, MongoDB API, SODA, SQL.

---

🔖 **Save this for quick reference when:**
- Choosing between ADW vs ATP
- Deciding Serverless vs Dedicated deployment
- Explaining ADB value to stakeholders
- Designing new apps or migrating workloads to Oracle Cloud

# 📌 Oracle Autonomous Database Licensing — Quick Reference Notes  
*Presented by Kamryn Vinson, Oracle University*

---

## 💡 What Are ECPUs?

- **ECPU** = **Elastic Compute Processing Unit** — Oracle’s abstract, performance-based compute metric for cloud.
- Not tied to physical cores or threads → **elastic allocation** from shared Exadata compute/storage pool.
- **Default compute model** for all new ADB instances (ADW & ATP).
- Decouples pricing from underlying hardware → avoids complexity during hardware refreshes.

---

## ✅ Benefits of ECPUs

- **Durable pricing metric** — unaffected by processor make/model/clock speed changes.
- **Finer granularity** for system sizing.
- **Auto-scaling support** (especially for ADW).
- **Reduced storage costs** for ADW when using ECPU model.

---

## ⚙️ Key Licensing & Pricing Details

### 🔹 Minimum Configuration
- **2 ECPUs minimum** for both ADW and ATP.
- Beyond 2 ECPUs → scale in **single-step increments** → maximum cost efficiency.

---

## 🧾 Licensing Models

### 1. **Pay-As-You-Go (Universal Credit Model - UCM)**
- Includes **all database options**.
- No need to own Oracle licenses.
- Pay only for what you use → **flexible, no upfront commitment**.
- Standard pricing → full feature access.

### 2. **Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL)**
- For customers with **existing Oracle Database licenses**.
- **Reduces cost** — pay a fraction of UCM pricing.
- Edition selection depends on licenses brought → affects **maximum ECPU limit**.

---

## 📊 BYOL Edition Limits & Requirements

| Oracle Edition         | Max ECPUs (w/ or w/o Auto-Scaling) | Additional License Requirements for >64 ECPUs |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Standard Edition**   | 32 ECPUs                            | N/A                                           |
| **Enterprise Edition** | Higher (depends on config)          | Requires **RAC licenses**                     |

> 💡 **To achieve 99.995% SLA under BYOL**, customer must have:
> - Oracle Enterprise Edition
> - Real Application Clusters (RAC)
> - Active Data Guard

---

## 💰 Universal Credit Pricing Structures

### 1. **Pay-As-You-Go (Consumption-Based)**
- Provision instantly → pay per unit of usage.
- Unit cost varies by service type.
- Includes required licenses (e.g., Oracle Database, options).

### 2. **Annual Universal Credits (Prepaid Model)**
- Like a **prepaid gift card** for OCI.
- **1-year minimum commitment**.
- Credits can be used across **any OCI IaaS/PaaS service**, in **any region**.
- **Volume discounts** available based on commitment size.
- No disruption to running services.

---

## 🔄 License Switching (Dynamic & Zero Downtime)

✅ You can **toggle between BYOL and License-Included (Pay-As-You-Go)** at any time:

**Steps to Switch (Console Example):**
1. Go to ADB instance → **More Actions** dropdown.
2. Select **“Update License and Oracle Database Edition”**.
3. Toggle radio button:  
   - **Enable License Included** → Subscribe to Enterprise Edition (Pay-As-You-Go).  
   - **Disable BYOL**.
4. Click **Save** → license type updates instantly → **no downtime**.

> 📌 License info disappears from console after switch — clean and seamless.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- **ECPU** = flexible, hardware-agnostic, cost-efficient compute unit.
- Choose **UCM (Pay-As-You-Go)** for simplicity & full features.
- Choose **BYOL** to reduce cost — if you have existing licenses.
- **Edition matters**: Standard Edition caps at 32 ECPUs; Enterprise supports higher + RAC.
- **99.995% SLA under BYOL** requires EE + RAC + Active Data Guard.
- **Annual Credits** = prepaid flexibility + potential discounts.
- **Switch licenses on-the-fly** → zero downtime, no service interruption.

---

🔖 **Save this when:**
- Advising customers on cost vs. licensing trade-offs.
- Configuring ADB with BYOL vs UCM.
- Planning for high availability (99.995% SLA).
- Needing to switch license models dynamically.

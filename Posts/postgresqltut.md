Absolutely! PostgreSQL is extremely deep and flexible â€” you can spend years mastering it. Hereâ€™s a curated list of 20 advanced and interesting concepts that are perfect for building tutorials, experiments, or deep-dives:

1. Table Access Methods (TAM)

Pluggable storage backends in PostgreSQL.

Create custom in-memory or columnar table storage.

2. Custom Index Methods

Implement your own index type (like GIN, GiST, SP-GiST, BRIN).

Perfect for specialized searches, e.g., vectors or spatial data.

3. pgvector & Vector Search

Store embeddings and perform nearest-neighbor searches inside Postgres.

Enables AI/ML integration directly in the database.

4. Logical Replication & WAL Streaming

Fine-grained replication of tables or rows.

Build real-time streaming apps.

5. FDW (Foreign Data Wrappers)

Query external data sources (SQL, NoSQL, files) as if they are tables.

Build your own FDW for custom data sources.

6. Custom Extensions

Write C or Rust extensions to extend Postgres functionality.

Examples: pg_trgm, pg_stat_statements, pgvector.

7. Procedural Languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Rust)

Write stored procedures in different languages.

Use Rust for high-performance logic.

8. Full-Text Search & Indexing

Built-in search engine with tsvector and tsquery.

Combine with GIN indexes for fast search.

9. Partitioning & Declarative Partitioning

Range, list, hash partitioning for huge datasets.

Combine with indexes and constraints for optimization.

10. JSONB & Document Storage

Semi-structured data storage with indexing and querying.

Perfect for NoSQL-style applications inside Postgres.

11. CTEs & Recursive Queries

Advanced query construction with Common Table Expressions.

Recursive queries for graph-like structures.

12. Window Functions

Advanced aggregations over partitions and frames.

Useful for analytics and reporting.

13. Parallel Queries

Multi-core query execution for large datasets.

Learn how Postgres parallelizes scans and joins.

14. Advisory Locks & Concurrency

Custom locking mechanisms.

Handle concurrency beyond row-level locks.

15. MVCC & Transaction Internals

Deep dive into Multi-Version Concurrency Control.

How PostgreSQL handles snapshots, conflicts, and isolation levels.

16. WAL & Crash Recovery

How Postgres guarantees durability and consistency.

Explore Write-Ahead Logs and recovery mechanisms.

17. Materialized Views & Refresh Strategies

Precomputed views for analytics.

Incremental refresh and indexing.

18. Logical Decoding & Change Data Capture

Stream changes from WAL to external systems.

Use for ETL, replication, or event sourcing.

19. Query Planner & Execution Insights

EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, and understanding execution plans.

Index vs seq scan, join types, cost estimation.

20. Security & RLS (Row-Level Security)

Advanced permission control per row.

Combine with policies and roles for fine-grained access.

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip for Tutorials:

Pick one topic per tutorial.

Include real examples, diagrams, and performance benchmarks.

Advanced topics like TAM, custom FDWs, pgvector, and custom extensions are especially unique and highly attractive to developers.



1. Query Planning & Execution

EXPLAIN vs EXPLAIN ANALYZE

Understanding Seq Scan, Index Scan, Bitmap Scan

Join strategies: Nested Loop, Hash Join, Merge Join

Cost estimation and row estimation

2. Indexing Strategies

B-Tree, Hash, GiST, GIN, SP-GiST, BRIN

Index-only scans

Partial indexes

Expression indexes

Covering indexes

3. Partitioning & Sharding

Declarative partitioning (Range, List, Hash)

Subpartitioning

Partition pruning and query optimization

Multi-node sharding strategies

4. Materialized Views & Caching

Precomputed query results

Refresh strategies (manual, concurrent, incremental)

Caching query results effectively

Using query caching for analytics

5. Configuration & Server Parameters

Memory settings: shared_buffers, work_mem, maintenance_work_mem

Checkpoints and WAL tuning: checkpoint_completion_target, wal_buffers

Autovacuum tuning: thresholds, scale factor, cost limit

Collecting accurate table statistics

Use of ANALYZE and auto stats collector

Histograms, most-common-values (MCV), n-distinct estimates

Impact of stale statistics on query planning

8. Query Rewriting & Optimization

Subquery vs CTE vs JOIN performance

Window function optimizations

Predicate pushdown

Minimize data retrieval: SELECT only required columns

Use of EXISTS, IN, and NOT EXISTS patterns efficiently

9. Concurrency & Locking

MVCC internals

Row-level locks vs advisory locks

Deadlock detection and prevention

Transaction isolation levels and performance impact

10. Monitoring & Benchmarking

pg_stat_statements for query profiling
